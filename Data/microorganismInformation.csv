Resistant to:

 Amoxicillin +/- clavulanate

Intrinsic fosfomycin resistance is present. It is sometimes tried in humans with cystitis because of the potential that high urine levels could still be effective, but efficacy is hard to predict.
Often resistant to:

 Aminoglycosides (especially gentamicin)
 Fluoroquinolones

3rd generation cephalosporin and carbapenem resistance can be encountered.
Trimethoprim sulfa and doxycycline are potential options but resistance can be present.
There is some in vitro activity of rifampin but it is not recommended in humans because it does not seem to offer much clinical benefit, alone or in combinations.
Minocycline and ceftazidime may be options in some cases. There may be few to no good options in some cases. Colistin is sometimes needed in humans.","Resource: Van der Kolk JH, Endimiani A, Graubner C, Gerber V, Perreten V. Acinetobacter in veterinary medicine, with an emphasis on Acinetobacter baumannii.
